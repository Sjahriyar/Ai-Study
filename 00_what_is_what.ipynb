    "Deep learning is a computer technique to extract and transform data–-with use cases ranging from human speech recognition to animal imagery classification–-by using multiple layers of neural networks. Each of these layers takes its inputs from previous layers and progressively refines them. The layers are trained by algorithms that minimize their errors and improve their accuracy. In this way, the network learns to perform a specified task.\n",

But it's not at all obvious what the model might look like for an image recognition program, or for understanding text, or for many other interesting problems we might imagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we would like is some kind of function that is so flexible that it could be used to solve any given problem, just by varying its weights. Amazingly enough, this function actually exists! It's the neural network, which we already discussed. That is, if you regard a neural network as a mathematical function, it turns out to be a function which is extremely flexible depending on its weights. A mathematical proof called the *universal approximation theorem* shows that this function can solve any problem to any level of accuracy, in theory. The fact that neural networks are so flexible means that, in practice, they are often a suitable kind of model, and you can focus your effort on the process of training them—that is, of finding good weight assignments.\n",

    "> A neural network with just **one hidden layer** (and enough neurons in that layer) can approximate **any function**, no matter how complicated, as long as the function is continuous.\n",
    "\n",

    "- If you have a problem where you want to map inputs to outputs (like predicting house prices, recognizing images, etc.), a neural network can learn to do it.\n",
    "- It doesn’t matter how crazy or complex the relationship between inputs and outputs is—given enough neurons, the neural network can figure it out.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **An Analogy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you’re trying to draw any shape—say, a circle, a wavy line, or even a weird squiggle. Now imagine you have a bunch of simple building blocks (like LEGO pieces). The Universal Approximation Theorem says:\n",

    "\n",
    "### **How Does It Work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neurons Are Like Little Functions**:\n",
    "   - Each neuron in the hidden layer performs a simple calculation (like multiplying inputs by weights and applying an activation function).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Combine Neurons to Approximate Complex Patterns**:\n",
    "   - By combining many neurons together, the network can create more and more complex patterns.\n",
    "   - Think of it like adding up lots of simple curves to make a complicated curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **One Hidden Layer Is Enough**:\n",
    "   - The theorem says you only need **one hidden layer** to approximate any function. However, in practice, deeper networks (with multiple layers) often work better and are more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the theorem is powerful, there are some important caveats:\n",
    "1. **\"Enough Neurons\" Can Be a Lot**:\n",
    "   - The theorem doesn’t say how many neurons you’ll need. For very complex problems, you might need thousands or millions of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Is Hard**:\n",
    "   - Even if a neural network *can* approximate any function, actually training it to do so might be tricky. You need good data, a good optimization algorithm, and lots of computational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Continuous Functions Only**:\n",
    "   - The theorem applies to continuous functions (smooth, unbroken patterns). If your problem involves sudden jumps or discontinuities, the neural network might struggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What It Says**:\n",
    "   - A neural network with one hidden layer can learn to approximate almost any function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why It Matters**:\n",
    "   - You don’t need to design custom solutions for every problem. Neural networks can \"figure it out\" for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simple Analogy**:\n",
    "   - Think of neurons as LEGO pieces. With enough of them, you can build any shape (or approximate any function).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-World Use**:\n",
    "   - This is why neural networks are used everywhere—from image recognition to language translation to self-driving cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Universal Approximation Theorem** says that a neural network with one hidden layer can learn to mimic almost any function, no matter how complicated, as long as you give it enough neurons. It’s like saying: \"With enough LEGO pieces, you can build anything!\" 😊\n",

But a metric is defined for human consumption, so a good metric is one that is easy for you to understand, and that hews as closely as possible to what you want the model to do.

There are some standard architectures that work most of the time, and in this case we're using one called _ResNet_ that we'll be talking a lot about during the book; it is both fast and accurate for many datasets and problems. The `34` in `resnet34` refers to the number of layers in this variant of the architecture (other options are `18`, `50`, `101`, and `152`). Models using architectures with more layers take longer to train, and are more prone to overfitting (i.e. you can't train them for as many epochs before the accuracy on the validation set starts getting worse).

    "An activation function is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron. It introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to learn and represent complex patterns in the data. Without this non-linearity feature, a neural network would behave like a linear regression model, no matter how many layers it has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation function decides whether a neuron should be activated by calculating the weighted sum of inputs and adding a bias term. This helps the model make complex decisions and predictions by introducing non-linearities to the output of each neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introducing Non-Linearity in Neural Network\n",
    "Non-linearity means that the relationship between input and output is not a straight line. In simple terms, the output does not change proportionally with the input. A common choice is the ReLU function, defined as $σ(x)=max(0,x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you want to classify apples and bananas based on their shape and color.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use a linear function, it can only separate them using a straight line.\n",
    "But real-world data is often more complex (e.g., overlapping colors, different lighting).\n",
    "By adding a non-linear activation function (like ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh), the network can create curved decision boundaries to separate them correcty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Non-Linearity Important in Neural Networks?\n",
    "Neural networks consist of neurons that operate using weights, biases, and activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the learning process, these weights and biases are updated based on the error produced at the output—a process known as backpropagation. Activation functions enable backpropagation by providing gradients that are essential for updating the weights and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without non-linearity, even deep networks would be limited to solving only simple, linearly separable problems. Activation functions empower neural networks to model highly complex data distributions and solve advanced deep learning tasks. Adding non-linear activation functions introduce flexibility and enable the network to learn more complex and abstract patterns from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Many Types Are There?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several common types of activation functions, but here are the most widely used ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Sigmoid**\n",
    "   - Formula: $ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} $\n",
    "   - Output: Between `0` and `1`.\n",
    "   - Use Case: Binary classification (e.g., predicting probabilities).\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     preds = xb.sigmoid()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**\n",
    "   - Formula: $ \\text{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x) $\n",
    "   - Output: `0` for negative inputs, and the input itself for positive inputs.\n",
    "   - Use Case: Hidden layers in deep neural networks (fast and effective).\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     preds = torch.relu(xb)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**\n",
    "   - Formula: $ \\tanh(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} $\n",
    "   - Output: Between `-1` and `1`.\n",
    "   - Use Case: Similar to sigmoid, but outputs are centered around `0`, which can help with training stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Softmax**\n",
    "   - Formula: $ \\text{Softmax}(x_i) = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_j e^{x_j}} $\n",
    "   - Output: Probabilities that sum to `1`.\n",
    "   - Use Case: Multi-class classification (e.g., predicting one of 10 digits in MNIST).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Do We Need Activation Functions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduce Non-Linearity**:\n",
    "   - Without activation functions, every layer in a neural network would just perform a linear transformation, making the entire network equivalent to a single linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enable Complex Learning**:\n",
    "   - Activation functions allow the network to learn non-linear relationships in the data, which is crucial for solving real-world problems like image recognition, language processing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Constraints**:\n",
    "   - Some activation functions (like sigmoid and softmax) constrain the output to specific ranges (e.g., probabilities between `0` and `1`)."

    "To make the training process go faster, we might start with a pretrained model—a model that has already been trained on someone else's data. We can then adapt it to our data by training it a bit more on our data, a process called fine-tuning.\n",
    "This is the key to deep learning—determining how to fit the parameters of a model to get it to solve your problem. In order to fit a model, we have to provide at least one piece of information: how many times to look at each image **(known as number of *epochs*)**. The number of epochs you select will largely depend on how much time you have available, and how long you find it takes in practice to fit your model. If you select a number that is too small, you can always train for more epochs later.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why is the method called `fine_tune`, and not `fit`? fastai actually *does* have a method called `fit`, which does indeed fit a model (i.e. look at images in the training set multiple times, each time updating the parameters to make the predictions closer and closer to the target labels). But in this case, we've started with a pretrained model, and we don't want to throw away all those capabilities that it already has. There are some important tricks to adapt a pretrained model for a new dataset—a process called *fine-tuning*.\n"

The risk is that if we train our model badly, instead of learning general lessons it effectively memorizes what it has already seen, and then it will make poor predictions about new images. Such a failure is called overfitting.\n",
    " In order to avoid this, we always divide our data into two parts, the training set and the validation set. We train the model by showing it only the training set and then we evaluate how well the model is doing by seeing how well it performs on items from the validation set. In this way, we check if the lessons the model learns from the training set are lessons that generalize to the validation set. In order for a person to assess how well the model is doing on the validation set overall, we define a metric."

    "The solution to this conundrum is to introduce another level of even more highly reserved data, the *test set*. Just as we hold back the validation data from the training process, we must hold back the test set data even from ourselves. It cannot be used to improve the model; it can only be used to evaluate the model at the very end of our efforts. In effect, we define a hierarchy of cuts of our data, based on how fully we want to hide it from training and modeling processes: training data is fully exposed, the validation data is less exposed, and test data is totally hidden. This hierarchy parallels the different kinds of modeling and evaluation processes themselves—the automatic training process with back propagation, the more manual process of trying different hyper-parameters between training sessions, and the assessment of our final result.\n",

    "The test and validation sets should have enough data to ensure that you get a good estimate of your accuracy. If you're creating a cat detector, for instance, you generally want at least 30 cats in your validation set. That means that if you have a dataset with thousands of items, using the default 20% validation set size may be more than you need. On the other hand, if you have lots of data, using some of it for validation probably doesn't have any downsides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having two levels of \"reserved data\"—a validation set and a test set, with one level representing data that you are virtually hiding from yourself—may seem a bit extreme. But the reason it is often necessary is because models tend to gravitate toward the simplest way to do good predictions (memorization), and we as fallible humans tend to gravitate toward fooling ourselves about how well our models are performing. The discipline of the test set helps us keep ourselves intellectually honest. That doesn't mean we *always* need a separate test set—if you have very little data, you may need to just have a validation set—but generally it's best to use one if at all possible."
