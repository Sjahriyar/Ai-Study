    "Data normalization is a vital pre-processing, mapping, and scaling method that helps forecasting and prediction models become more accurate. The current data range is transformed into a new, standardized range using this method. Normalization is extremely important when it comes to bringing disparate prediction and forecasting techniques into harmony. Data normalization improves the consistency and comparability of different predictive models by standardizing the range of independent variables or features within a dataset, leading to more steady and dependable results."
